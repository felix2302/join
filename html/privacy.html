                    stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per
                    Art. 18 GDPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                    to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by

                    party in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77

                restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18
                GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is
                impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users
                have a right to information about these recipients.
