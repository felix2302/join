            <h2 class="help-padding-24">What is Join?</h2>
            <p class="help-padding-16">
                <span class="color-lightblue"> Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
                by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
            </p>
            <p class="help-padding-16">
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
                method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
                efficiency (or flow). <span class="color-lightblue"> Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to
                help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
            </p>
            <p class="help-padding-24">
                It is important to note that <span class="color-lightblue"> Join</span> is designed as an educational
                exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible

            <h2 class="help-padding-24">How to use it</h2>
            <p class="help-padding-16">Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="color-lightblue">
                    Join</span>:</p>

                    <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you log in to <span class="color-lightblue"> Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
                        board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                        feedback” and "Done".
                    </p>

                    <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                    <p>
                        In <span class="color-lightblue"> Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                        projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
                        information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the
                        tasks on the board.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                        Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                        appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
                        the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
                        on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
                        another.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                        list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
                        the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                        action is irreversible.
                    </p>
